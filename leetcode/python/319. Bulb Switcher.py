# here we use double asterisk[**] this double asterisk are a kind of Arithemetic operators
# also knows as power operators.

# In a function definition, the double asterisk is also known ** kwargs

# example:

# a = 2
# b = 5
# c = a**b
# print(c)

# output:
# 32

# calculation:
# 2⁵ = 2×2×2×2×2 = 32

# basically ** calculates the exponent where,
# the first variable is the base and 2nd variable is the exponent variable
