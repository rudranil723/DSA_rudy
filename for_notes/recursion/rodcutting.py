# Rod Cutting Problem

# Given a rod of length n and a list of rod prices of length i, where 1 <= i <= n,
#  find the optimal way to cut the rod into smaller rods to maximize profit.


# Input:

# length[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# price[] = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]

# Rod length: 4


# Best: Cut the rod into two pieces of length 2 each to gain revenue of 5 + 5 = 10

# Cut           Profit
# 4                9
# 1, 3            (1 + 8) = 9
# 2, 2            (5 + 5) = 10
# 3, 1            (8 + 1) = 9
# 1, 1, 2         (1 + 1 + 5) = 7
# 1, 2, 1         (1 + 5 + 1) = 7
# 2, 1, 1         (5 + 1 + 1) = 7
# 1, 1, 1, 1      (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 4


# Practice This Problem

# We are given an array price[], where the rod of length i has a value price[i-1]. The idea is simple – one by one, partition the given rod of length n into two parts: i and n-i. Recur for the rod of length n-i but don’t divide the rod of length i any further. Finally, take the maximum of all values. This yields the following recursive relation:

# rodcut(n) = max { price[i – 1] + rodCut(n – i) } where 1 <= i <= n


import sys

# Function to find the best way to cut a rod of length `n`
# where the rod of length `i` has a cost `price[i-1]`


def rodCut(price, n):

    # base case
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    maxValue = -sys.maxsize

    # one by one, partition the given rod of length `n` into two parts of length
    # (1, n-1), (2, n-2), (3, n-3), … ,(n-1, 1), (n, 0) and take maximum
    for i in range(1, n + 1):

        # rod of length `i` has a cost `price[i-1]`
        cost = price[i - 1] + rodCut(price, n - i)

        if cost > maxValue:
            maxValue = cost

    return maxValue


if __name__ == '__main__':

    price = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]

    # rod length
    n = 4

    print('Profit is', rodCut(price, n))
